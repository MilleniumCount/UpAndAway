# TODO for Up and Away

+ **Current Developments:*

	-- Debug's List

	+ Allow for more cloud stuff in the overworld, and vice-versa.
	+ Bean Giant fight implementation. Groan.
	+ Winnie character art implementation.
	+ Quartz Torch implementation. It should act as a torch that does not dissappear upon loss of fuel. Can be placed into the refiner, placed into quartz lamps, or given to entities to increase reputation with that faction.

+ **Current bugs:**

    + Attempting to use Obisidian Staff in the cloudrealm results in a crash.
    + Octocopter will not attack entities.
    + Shipwrecked recipes not available in cloudrealm. This is technically working as intended.
    + When climbing a beanstalk in a Shipwrecked world, recipes break.
    + Lightning strikes cause static to start.


+ **Art assets in need of attention**

	+ Check our [dedicated TODO list](TODO_ART.md).

+ **Code assets in need of attention**

	+ Add ambiant sound to the cloudrealm. Sounds now exist in mod files.
	+ Bean Giant is being overhauled.	
	+ Shopkeeper Boss Quest implementation
	+ Gnomes are being overhauled.
	+ Add a slight visual effect to static damage.
	+ Port golden egg corruption to DST.
	+ Superconductor implementation.
	+ Unique item implementation.

+** Strings in need of attention**

	+ New stuff.
	
+ **Miscellanea (Suggestions to be considered) **

	+ Clockwork biome: http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/?p=507711 (This is something I've thought more about. The player should have something more easily relateable once they make some progress in the Cloudrealm. Doesn't have to be clockwork stuff necessarily. Consider it pavlovion. Not that I want the mod to become a skinner-box, but that kind of attribute is necessary to a point in design and balance.)

	+ Stuffed animals that can be created with the sewing kit. They start as a cotton frame, and become a random stuffed animal when sewn. They give very small amounts of sanity and warmth when used.

	+ Rhinomen confirmed. http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/19488-dont-starve-supermod-mod-abandoned/page-47#entry192646
	http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/3988-the-majestic-rhino-tribe/

	+ Cooked foods. http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/page-56?p=500493#entry500493

******

Anything else that needs to be added will be added (eventually). 
If something is missing (bugs or otherwise), let either @simplex or @debugman18 know.
