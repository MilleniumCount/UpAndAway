###Progression Document for Up and Away (Together)

Items in _Italics_ represent steps which are prerequisites for future tiers of progression.

Items in "quotes" are vanilla items.

Items like axe, harvest, etc. all represent actions. Inventory items will be denoted by (Item).

Prequisites are only virtually required to progress to the next tier of progression. The flow of progression is widened depending on the individual player's ability to conquer obstacles.
 
This document is a work in progress. (Duh)
