# TODO for Up and Away

+ **Current Developments:*

	-- Debug's List

	+ Random horizontal flipping of jellyshrooms to reduce repetiveness.
	+ Allow for more cloud stuff in the overworld, and vice-versa.
	+ Bean Giant fight implementation. Groan.
	+ Winnie character art implementation.
	+ Quartz Torch placable into quartz lamps, givable to entities to increase reputation with that faction.

+ **Current bugs:**

    + Attempting to use Obisidian Staff in the cloudrealm results in a crash.
    + Lightning flash causes default ambient lighting (colour) to be used.
	+ Winnie's meatbulb recipe is visible to anyone.
	+ Quartz torch errors.

+ **Art assets in need of attention**

	+ Check our [dedicated TODO list](TODO_ART.md).

+ **Code assets in need of attention**

	+ Add ambiant sound to the cloudrealm. Sounds now exist in mod files.
	+ Bean Giant is being overhauled.
	+ Shopkeeper Boss Quest implementation.
	+ Gnomes are being overhauled.
	+ Port golden egg corruption to DST.
	+ Superconductor implementation.
	+ Unique item implementation.

+ ** Strings in need of attention**

	+ New stuff.

+ **Miscellanea (Suggestions to be considered) **

	+ Clockwork biome: http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/?p=507711 (This is something I've thought more about. The player should have something more easily relateable once they make some progress in the Cloudrealm. Doesn't have to be clockwork stuff necessarily. Consider it pavlovion. Not that I want the mod to become a skinner-box, but that kind of attribute is necessary to a point in design and balance.)

	+ Stuffed animals that can be created with the sewing kit. They start as a cotton frame, and become a random stuffed animal when sewn. They give very small amounts of sanity and warmth when used. -- I think there is a mod that basically does this. --Debug

	+ Rhinomen confirmed. http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/19488-dont-starve-supermod-mod-abandoned/page-47#entry192646
	http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/3988-the-majestic-rhino-tribe/

	+ Cooked foods. http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/page-56?p=500493#entry500493

	+ Gummybear traps.

******

Anything else that needs to be added will be added (eventually). 
If something is missing (bugs or otherwise), let either @simplex or @debugman18 know.
