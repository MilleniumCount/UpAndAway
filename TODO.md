# TODO for Up and Away

+ **Current bugs:**

	+ World generation time is too short. (Vanilla bug?)

+ **Art assets in need of attention**

	+ Check our [dedicated TODO list](TODO_ART.md).

+ **Code assets in need of attention**

	+ These need to be clarified and tuned; see Cavetroll thread.

	+ Gnome Revamp
	+ Faction Implementation
	+ Winnie Revamp
	+ Bean Giant Revamp and Setpiece
	+ Shopkeeper Boss Quest

+ **General improvements to be made:*

	+ Allow for more cloud stuff in the overworld.
	+ Adjust world density.
	+ More teas.

+ **Miscellanea (Suggestions to be considered) **

	+ Semiconductor drop: http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/?p=511029 (I was thinking that the main bosses could all drop parts to be used to ascend, as well as an item to be used for a RoG-esque craftable. This would change the current function of the octocopter. Something to be thrown to the forums for feedback. This will happen with the flowchart of the mod experience.)

	+ Clockwork biome: http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/?p=507711 (This is something I've thought more about. The player should have something more easily relateable once they make some progress in the Cloudrealm. Doesn't have to be clockwork stuff necessarily. Consider it pavlovion. Not that I want the mod to become a skinner-box, but that kind of attribute is necessary to a point in design and balance.)

******

Anything else that needs to be added will be added, current version is from memory. 
If something is missing (bugs or otherwise), let either @simplex or @debugman18 know.
